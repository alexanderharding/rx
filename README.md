# @xan/rx

A set of tooling that encapsulates the
[Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) in JavaScript
taking inspiration from [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)

## Build

Run `ng build observable` to build the project. The build artifacts will be
stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

Go to the project folder `cd .\projects\observable\` and run `npx jsr publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test observable` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Example

```ts
import { Observable } from "@xan/rx";

const observable = new Observable<0>((observer) => {
  // Note that this logic is invoked for every new subscribe action.

  // If the observer is already aborted, there's no work to do.
  if (observer.signal.aborted) return;

  // Create a timeout as our producer to next a value after 1 second.
  const producer = setTimeout(() => {
    // Next the value to the observer
    observer.next(0);
    // The producer is done, notify complete
    observer.complete();
  }, 1000);

  // Add an abort listener to handle unsubscription by canceling the producer
  observer.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => clearTimeout(producer), {
    once: true,
  });
});
```

# Glossary And Semantics

When discussing and documenting observables, it's important to have a common
language and a known set of rules around what is going on. This document is an
attempt to standardize these things so we can try to control the language in our
docs, and hopefully other publications about this library, so we can discuss
reactive programming with this library on consistent terms.

While not all of the documentation for this library reflects this terminology,
it is a goal of the team to ensure it does, and to ensure the language and names
around the library use this document as a source of truth and unified language.

## Major Entities

There are high level entities that are frequently discussed. It's important to
define them separately from other lower-level concepts, because they relate to
the nature of observable.

### Consumer

The code that is subscribing to the
[observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable). This is whoever is being
notified of [producer](#producer) notifications.

### Producer

Any system or thing that is the source of values that are being pushed out of
the observable subscription to the [consumer](#consumer). This can be a wide
variety of things, from a `Promise` to a simple iteration over an `Array`. The
producer is most often created during the [subscribe](#subscribe) action, and
therefor "owned" by a [subscription](#subscription) in a one-to-one way
resulting in a [unicast](#unicast), but that is not always the case. A producer
may be shared between many subscriptions, if it is created outside of the
[subscribe](#subscribe) action, in which case it is one-to-many, resulting in a
[multicast](#multicast). This manifested as a
[producer observer](#producerobserver)

### Subscription

A contract where a [consumer](#consumer) is [observing](#observation) values
pushed by a [producer](#producer). The subscription, is an ongoing process that
amounts to the function of the observable from the [consumer](#consumer)'s
perspective. Subscription starts the moment a [subscribe](#subscribe) action is
initiated, even before the [subscribe](#subscribe) action is finished.

## Major Actions

There are specific actions and events that occur between major entities in the
library that need to be defined. These major actions are the highest level
events that occur within various parts of the library.

### Observation

A [consumer](#consumer) reacting to [producer](#producer) notifications. This
can only happen _during_ [subscription](#subscription).

### Observation Chain

When an [observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) uses another
[observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) as a
[producer](#producer), an "observation chain" is set up. That is a chain of
[observation](#observation) such that multiple [observers](#observer) are
notifying each other in a unidirectional way toward the final
[consumer](#consumer).

## Major Concepts

Some of what we discuss is conceptual. These are mostly common traits of
behaviors that can manifest in observables or in push-based reactive systems.

### Multicast

The act of one [producer](#producer) being [observed](#observation) by **many**
[consumers](#consumer).

### Unicast

The act of one [producer](#producer) being [observed](#observation) by **only
one** [consumer](#consumer). An observable is "unicast" when it only connects
one [producer](#producer) to one [consumer](#consumer). Unicast doesn't
necessarily mean ["cold"](#cold).

### Cold

An observable is "cold" when it creates a new [producer](#producer) during
[subscribe](#subscribe) for every new [subscription](#subscription). As a
result, "cold" observables are _always_ [unicast](#unicast), being one
[producer](#producer) [observed](#observation) by one [consumer](#consumer).
Cold observables can be made [hot](#hot) but not the other way around.

### Hot

An observable is "hot", when its [producer](#producer) was created outside of
the context of the [subscribe](#subscribe) action. This means that the "hot"
observable is almost always [multicast](#multicast). It is possible that a "hot"
observable is still _technically_ unicast, if it is engineered to only allow one
[subscription](#subscription) at a time, however, there is no straightforward
mechanism for this in the library, and the scenario is an unlikely one. For the
purposes of discussion, all "hot" observables can be assumed to be
[multicast](#multicast). Hot observables cannot be made [cold](#cold).

### Push

[Observables](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) are a push-based type.
That means rather than having the [consumer](#consumer) call a function or
perform some other action to get a value, the [consumer](#consumer) receives
values as soon as the [producer](#producer) has produced them, via a registered
[next](#next) handler.

### Pull

Pull-based systems are the opposite of [push](#push)-based. In a pull-based type
or system, the [consumer](#consumer) must request each value the
[producer](#producer) has produced manually, perhaps long after the
[producer](#producer) has actually done so. Examples of such systems are
[Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
and
[Iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)

## Minor Entities

### Source

An [observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) that will supply values
to another [observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable). This
[source](#source), will be the [producer](#producer) for the resulting
[observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) and all of its
[subscriptions](#subscriptions). Sources may generally be any type of
observable.

### Notifier

An [observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) that is being used to
notify another [observable](https://jsr.io/@xan/rx/doc/~/Observable) that it
needs to perform some action. The action should only occur on a [next](#next)
and never on [error](#error), [complete](#complete), or [finally](#finally).

## Other Concepts

### Unhandled Errors

An "unhandled error" is any [error](#error) that is not handled by a
[consumer](#consumer)-provided function, which is generally provided during the
[subscribe](#subscribe) action. If no error handler was provided, the library
will assume the error is "unhandled" and rethrow the error on a new callstack to
prevent ["producer interference"](#producer-interference).

### Producer Interference

[Producer](#producer) interference happens when an error is allowed to unwind
the library's callstack during notification. When this happens, the error could
break things like for-loops in [upstream](#upstream-and-downstream)
[sources](#source) that are notifying [consumers](#consumer) during a
[multicast](#multicast). That would cause the other [consumers](#consumer) in
that [multicast](#multicast) to suddenly stop receiving values without logical
explanation. The library goes out of its way to prevent producer interference by
ensuring that all unhandled errors are thrown on a separate callstack.
